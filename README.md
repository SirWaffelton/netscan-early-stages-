similar to my other scanner but this detects live hosts, gives them names based on MAC address. Also shows open ports, allows for self skipping to give accurate results, creates json and cvs files to compare for changes in port accessability, also displays type of address, and is one file :D

ps dont forget to run venv cuz nothing works without it

you can make a private python server with venv to test the scanner out
